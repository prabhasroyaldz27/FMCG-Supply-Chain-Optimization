ðŸ“Š Data Visualization â€“ Supply Chain Management Dashboard
Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a real-time view of key supply chain metrics such as total supply, demand-supply gaps, and regional transport issues. By integrating predictive analytics, clustering, and interactive visualizations, it enables informed decision-making, aligns supply with demand, reduces inventory costs, and enhances operational efficiency.

This initial phase highlights the value of data-driven supply chain management and sets the foundation for expanding the model into a comprehensive, end-to-end solution.

Tool Used: Microsoft Power BI
