ðŸš€ Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering is a crucial step in the data preprocessing pipeline. It involves creating, transforming, and selecting the most relevant features to improve the performance of machine learning models.

âœ¨ Key Techniques Used
Missing Value Handling
Imputation using mean/median/mode or domain-specific values.

Encoding Categorical Variables
Applied One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding to convert categorical data into numerical format.

Feature Transformation
Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler and normalized skewed distributions with log transformation.

Date-Time Feature Extraction
Extracted features like year, month, day, dayofweek, and is_weekend from date fields.

Interaction Features
Created new features by combining multiple columns (e.g., price * quantity = total_sales).

Binning
Bucketed continuous variables into discrete intervals (e.g., age groups).

Feature Selection
Removed low-variance or highly correlated features to reduce model complexity.
