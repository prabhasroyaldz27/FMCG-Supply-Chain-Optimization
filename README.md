📦 FMCG Supply Chain Optimization – Instant Noodles
Optimizing operational efficiency in this context means reducing demand–supply mismatches at every stage of the supply chain. This ensures that the right quantity of instant noodles is produced, stored, and delivered to meet customer demand without overstocking or stockouts.

Supply Chain Management (SCM) here refers to the complete set of processes involved in:
Creation → sourcing raw materials and producing instant noodles.
Storage → managing warehouses efficiently based on capacity and demand.
Movement → transporting noodles across regions to ensure timely delivery.

The goal is to synchronize these processes so that demand is met efficiently, costs are minimized, and customer satisfaction is maximized.
This project focuses on solving supply-demand mismatches in the distribution network of a leading FMCG company's instant noodles product.

## 📅 Duration
 Kaggle-based dataset project

## 📌 Description
High-demand regions face stockouts, while low-demand areas see oversupply. Using machine learning and clustering, the project builds a predictive system to optimize inventory allocation across warehouses.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn)
- Power BI
- Kaggle Dataset

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 Feature Engineering: Demand-supply ratio, warehouse utilization, competitor presence
- 🤖 ML Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- 📍 Clustering: K-Means for demand segmentation
- 📉 Power BI Dashboard: Demand-supply heatmaps, competitor analysis

## 🎯 Goal
Minimize inventory cost, reduce stockouts, and maximize sales by aligning supply with regional demand forecasts.
