# 📦 FMCG Supply Chain Optimization – Instant Noodles

This project focuses on solving supply-demand mismatches in the distribution network of a leading FMCG company's instant noodles product.

## 📅 Duration
Ongoing – Kaggle-based dataset project

## 📌 Description
High-demand regions face stockouts, while low-demand areas see oversupply. Using machine learning and clustering, the project builds a predictive system to optimize inventory allocation across warehouses.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn)
- Power BI
- Kaggle Dataset

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 Feature Engineering: Demand-supply ratio, warehouse utilization, competitor presence
- 🤖 ML Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- 📍 Clustering: K-Means for demand segmentation
- 📉 Power BI Dashboard: Demand-supply heatmaps, competitor analysis

## 🎯 Goal
Minimize inventory cost, reduce stockouts, and maximize sales by aligning supply with regional demand forecasts.
