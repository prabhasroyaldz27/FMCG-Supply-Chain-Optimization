# ðŸ“¦ Business Problem  

A FMCG company has entered into the instant noodles business two years back.  
The higher management has noticed that there is a mismatch in the demand and supply.  

- Where the demand is high, supply is pretty low  
- Where the demand is low, supply is pretty high  

In both cases, it results in an **inventory cost loss** to the company.  
Hence, the higher management wants to optimize the **supply quantity** in each and every warehouse across the country.
