# K-Means Clustering for Demand Pattern Analysis by Region

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to identify demand patterns across different regions.  
By grouping warehouses/regions into demand clusters, the company can optimize logistics, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights from Clustering
- **Elbow Method:**  
  - Steep drop in WCSS from **1 to 3 clusters** â†’ strong improvement in grouping.  
  - After 3, curve flattens â†’ no major gain.  
  - âœ… Optimal number of clusters = **3**  

- **Silhouette Score:**  
  - Provides measure of clustering quality.  
  - Higher score = better defined clusters.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Impact
Clustering helps the company:
- ðŸ“¦ **Reduce Costs**: Avoid unnecessary shipments to low-demand areas.  
- ðŸ’° **Maximize Revenue**: Ensure products are available where most needed.  
- ðŸŽ¯ **Optimize Marketing**: Tailor strategies for each demand group.  
- ðŸ˜€ **Improve Customer Satisfaction**: Better availability and service.

## ðŸ›  Application for FMCG Data
If clusters represent **Low, Medium, and High Demand zones**:
- **High-demand areas** â†’ Priority shipments, strong advertising.  
- **Medium-demand areas** â†’ Balanced supply and marketing.  
- **Low-demand areas** â†’ Different marketing tactics, fewer resources.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visual Results
- **Elbow Method Graph** â†’ Shows optimal `k=3`.  
- **Cluster Visualization** â†’ Displays regional demand grouping.
